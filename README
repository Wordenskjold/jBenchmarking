 Simple Benchmarker for small running-time measurements.
Pass a Runnable or a Benchmarkable to a BenchMarker object, and call start to measure the running time in ms of the method or runnable. 

Example usage:

new BenchMarker(new Runnable(){
  public void run() {
  // Do something!
  }}).start();

You can set the number of method executions manually:

benchmarker.setAccuracy(20);
benchmarker.start();
